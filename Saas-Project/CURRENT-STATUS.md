# SAAS-UMKM Project Status Update

## Current Status

The project is in the process of migrating from a microservice architecture to a monolithic architecture for improved development and reduced operational complexity. The new architecture aims to make deployment to a VPS with 8GB RAM more manageable.

## Test Results Summary

### Backend Issues

- **Compilation errors in backend code:**
  - Missing Display implementation for `LicenseType` and `ApplicationStatus` enums
  - Missing implementation for several methods in the `LicenseRepository` trait
  - SQL field mapping issues between database schema and struct fields
  - PgConnectOptions methods no longer available in current sqlx version
  - Rate limiter module not found
  - Service layer configuration errors

### Frontend Status

- The frontend component appears to be working correctly
- Type checking, linting should pass but need to run test scripts to confirm

### Docker/Infrastructure

- Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis) appear to be configured correctly
- Warning about obsolete `version` attribute in docker-compose.yml has been fixed

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Fixes:**

   - Complete the implementation of the LicenseRepository trait
   - Fix struct field mapping with database schema
   - Update database connection options to match current sqlx API
   - Implement or fix the rate limiter module

2. **Testing:**

   - After backend fixes, run the test script to verify end-to-end functionality
   - Test API endpoints for expected responses

3. **Deployment:**
   - Update deployment scripts for the monolithic architecture
   - Verify monitoring configuration for the VPS environment

## Notes for Development

- The PostgreSQL container is configured with optimizations for an 8GB RAM VPS
- Redis is configured with memory limits appropriate for the VPS size
- The database connection in tests should use the credentials from docker-compose:
  - User: saas_user
  - Password: saas_password
  - Database: saas_umkm_db
