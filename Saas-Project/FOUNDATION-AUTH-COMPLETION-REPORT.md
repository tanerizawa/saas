  - `email_verification_token VARCHAR(255)`
  - `password_reset_token VARCHAR(255)`
  - `password_reset_expires TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`
  - `last_login TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Migration applied successfully

### 2. Database Connectivity
- **Setup**: PostgreSQL 15 container with Docker Compose
- **Extensions**: Added uuid-ossp for UUID generation
