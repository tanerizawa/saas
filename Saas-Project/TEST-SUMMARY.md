# SaaS UMKM Platform Testing Summary

## Test Results

### Docker Services

✅ **Status**: Working correctly

- PostgreSQL 15.13 is running and accessible
- Redis 7.4.5 is running and accessible
- Connection strings are properly configured
- Docker version: 28.1.1

### Backend

❌ **Status**: Needs fixes

- Compilation errors in multiple files
- Issues with License Repository implementation
- Database schema and entity mapping issues
- Middleware configuration problems

### Frontend

✅ **Status**: Working correctly (based on file examination)

- Modern Next.js 15.4.2 setup
- TypeScript configuration looks good
- Need to run test scripts to verify fully

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Fixes**

   - Follow the task plan in `/backend/FIXME-TASK-PLAN.md`
   - Implement Display trait for custom enums (already fixed)
   - Complete LicenseRepository implementation
   - Fix database connection options
   - Address middleware issues

2. **Database Setup**

   - The database connection credentials should be:
     ```
     User: saas_user
     Password: saas_password
     Database: saas_umkm_db
     Host: localhost
     Port: 5432
     ```

3. **Updated Scripts**
   - `test-docker-services.sh`: Use to verify Docker services status
   - `setup-and-test.sh`: Sets environment variables and runs tests
   - `setup-dev.sh`: Updated for modern Docker Compose and database config

## Notes

- The docker-compose.yml file has been updated to remove obsolete version attribute
- Redis and PostgreSQL are configured with optimizations for an 8GB RAM VPS
- Need to address the backend compilation issues before testing API endpoints

## Recommendations

1. Fix the backend code following the task plan
2. Run the unit tests after fixing compilation issues
3. Deploy to VPS following the monolithic architecture plan
4. Set up monitoring with the updated Prometheus and Grafana configuration
