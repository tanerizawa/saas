# ðŸš¨ URGENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - POST PHASE 4A

## **âš¡ CRITICAL PRIORITIES (NEXT 24-48 HOURS)**

### **ðŸ”´ PRIORITY 1: Database Repository Integration**
**Impact**: High - Services cannot persist data without this
**Files to Update**:
- `backend/src/services/onboarding.rs` - Replace TODO comments with database operations
- `backend/src/services/license_processing.rs` - Add actual license data persistence  
- `backend/src/services/system_config.rs` - Connect to configuration database tables

**Tasks**:
1. Create repository layer for each service
2. Replace mock implementations with actual database calls
3. Add database migrations for new tables
4. Test data persistence end-to-end

### **ðŸŸ  PRIORITY 2: Payment Gateway Integration (Midtrans/Xendit)**
**Impact**: High - Required for revenue generation
**Implementation Scope**:
- Payment service layer (`backend/src/services/payment.rs`)
- Subscription management system
- Invoice generation with automated workflows
- Payment webhook handlers for status updates
- Integration with license activation workflow

**Business Value**: Direct revenue impact, automated subscription billing

### **ðŸŸ¡ PRIORITY 3: Frontend-Backend Integration Testing**
**Impact**: Medium - Ensure all new APIs work with existing frontend
**Testing Areas**:
- Onboarding workflow integration with UMKM registration
- License processing API calls from admin/staff interfaces
- Email service triggered from frontend actions
- System configuration changes reflecting in UI
